Emacs Prelude's jwintz fork

## Credits

Prelude is an amazing emacs configuration system developed by Bozhidar Ivanov Batsov. See http://batsov.com/prelude/.

## Install

Assuming you're using an Unix-like OS (`*BSD`, `GNU/Linux`, `OS X`, `Solaris`,
etc), you already have Emacs 24 installed, as well as `git` & `curl` you
can skip the whole manual and just type in your favorite shell the
following command:

```bash
$ curl -L https://github.com/jwintz/prelude/raw/master/utils/installer.sh | sh
```

You can now power up your Emacs, sit back and enjoy Prelude. Everything will be installed into ~/.emacs.d.
