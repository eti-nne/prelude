Emacs Prelude's jwintz fork
===========================

> Emacs is probably the best text editor in the world. However, the
process of coming up with a useful Emacs configuration is long and
difficult. It's this process that separates you from truly taking
advantage of Emacs's power. I like to refer to this process as the
**Prelude**. **Emacs Prelude** has the goal to ease the initial Emacs
setup process and to provide you with a much more powerful and
productive experience than the one you get out of the box. By using
**Emacs Prelude** you're basically getting a *"Get me out of the
Prelude, I just want to use Emacs"* card.

Prelude is a wonderful initiative, and a very smart contribution. This
is my very own Emacs Prelude's fork. People will generally not use it
except they share my emacs' experience.

## Credits

Prelude is an amazing emacs configuration system developed by Bozhidar Ivanov Batsov. See http://batsov.com/prelude/.

## Install

Assuming you're using an Unix-like OS (`*BSD`, `GNU/Linux`, `OS X`, `Solaris`,
etc), you already have Emacs 24 installed, as well as `git` & `curl` you
can skip the whole manual and just type in your favorite shell the
following command:

```bash
$ curl -L https://github.com/jwintz/prelude/raw/master/utils/installer.sh | sh
```

You can now power up your Emacs, sit back and enjoy Prelude. Everything will be installed into ~/.emacs.d.
